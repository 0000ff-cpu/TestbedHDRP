This is a testbed project for [Unity HDRP] (High Definition Render Pipeline).
It contains several scenes that aim to try out the new functionalities of HDRP.
Please note that they're not necessarily useful nor showing right use of the
functionalities. I'm just trying to explore the possibilities of the new
features.

System requirements
-------------------

- Unity 2018.2 or later

How to use the project
----------------------

This repository includes some [submodules]. Before opening the project with
Unity, not only the repository itself but also these submodules have to be
synced up.

If you're using Git from the command line, run `git submodule init` and
`git submodule update` in the project directory. Or you can just use the
`--recursive` option when initially cloning the repository.

If you're using a Git GUI client, please refer to the manual for information
about submodules.
